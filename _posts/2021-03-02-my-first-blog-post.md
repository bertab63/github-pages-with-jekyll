I'm trying to learn how to create a Blog through the lessons in GitHub.  I feel pretty lost and stuck at this point.  GitHub Bot was directing me and now my Pull requests are requiring reviews.  I've asked for reviews but don't really know what to do one they are completely.  It's still showing I need at least one of my Pull requests reviewed.  Hopefully I'll get one and the Bot will tell me what my next move should be.
